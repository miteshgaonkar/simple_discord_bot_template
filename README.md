# Simple Discord Bot Template

This is a basic Discord bot template built with Node.js and the Discord.js library. It demonstrates how to create a simple bot that can respond to messages in Discord servers.

## Features

- Listens for messages containing the phrase "Hi" and replies with a greeting.
- Includes commented-out code examples for generating random numbers, using switch statements, and conditional statements.
- Easily configurable by replacing placeholders with your bot's name and token.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- A Discord bot token (obtain one from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-discord-bot-template.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd simple-discord-bot-template`

3. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`

4. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and replace `<Your bot key>` with your actual Discord bot token.

5. Start the bot: `node index.js` or `npm start`

Your bot should now be online and ready to respond to messages in the servers it has been added to.

## Customization

You can further customize the bot's behavior by modifying the code in the `index.js` file. The commented-out code snippets provide examples of how to generate random numbers, use switch statements, and conditional statements.

## Dependencies
